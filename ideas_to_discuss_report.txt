LIST OF CHOICES (to be discussed and justified on the report)
---------------

· Treatment of outliers: keep them or modify them?
· Amount of lag features to be used: 1 day (48 observations), 1 week (48*7)...
· Engineering features applied: work-day/weekend-day, outlier or not, etc...
· Whether to apply data transformation or not (using a box-cox transformation or some other technique)
· Whether to apply regularization or not: most likely yes (since measures of the order of thousands will be used alongside very small ones)
· Resampling technique to be used: classical train-test split, walk-forward validation...
· Which prediction algorithms to be used and WHY
(To do if there's enough time): discuss the method of grid search of hyperparameters for each model
· Performance scoring measure(s) used
· Decisions taken in light of the results of each model (after analysis of residuals, for example).

· Improvements: application of algorithms not used here, comparison of results between transformed and not transformed data, etc.
