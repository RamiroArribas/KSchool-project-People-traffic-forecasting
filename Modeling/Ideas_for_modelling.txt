Ideas to explore when modeling
------------------------------

· Create a notebook called 'custom_functions' from which to call the defined functions: train_trest_dev_split, get_future_predictions, walk_forward validations, etc.

· Tune each model grid-searching for the proper hyperparameters using known future data and all columns. 
· Create a notebook from which to farm the results (maybe not needed for all models):

    - Create a DataFrame containing the results extracted for each model, time window (1 day, 3 days, 7 days) and SiteId: running the notebook for all test_data will be enough, after that it would just be needed to extract the proper rows. Make sure the test_data portion starts from time of day 00:00:00
    
    
        Format: N-rows x (columns)
        Columns = 
        known observations
        predict using lags from known future and all columns
        predict using lags from known future and no external data
        predict using lags of Unknown future (use custom function) and all columns
        predict using lags of Unknown future (use custom function) and no external data
        
     
    - Perform the residuals analysis, extract RMSE and r2-adjusted
    - Create a matrix of running time for each result extracted
