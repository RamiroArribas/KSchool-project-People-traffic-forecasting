# KSchool project: People traffic forecasting


This is my project for the Data Science Master in KSchool. The purpose of it is to demonstrate the knowledge and skills acquired during the Master's. I wanted it to be industry related, so I decided to look for companies willing to share their data. The project is the result of my collaboration with iMotion analytics (http://www.imotionanalytics.com/), a company that dedicate efforts to extract customer insights through biometric data for a variety of domains.

The objective has been to establish the basis for the implementation of a people traffic forecasting model. Specifically, their interest lies in finding an all-around model (as less domain-specific as possible) as a first approach to include this service in their catalogue.

For reviewing the project, first of all please refer to the requirements section below. It provides instructions to set the environment to run it. It is recommended to follow the notebooks in order as per their index. For a detailed description of the project, please refer to the [memorandum](https://github.com/RamiroArribas/People_traffic_forecasting/blob/master/memorandum.pdf). 


Any comment or suggestion will be more than welcome.


Requirements:
-------------

It is highly encouraged to run the project on a new python environment:

conda create -n ptfenv python=3.6

Afterwards, activate the new environment created (named 'ptfenv') and install the necessary libraries running the following instruction in your console:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Done!
